# CV
Curriculum Vitae - semi-automated generation of CV files. Editting is performed on the `.odt` files, then by running `make` the files are converted to `.doc` and `.pdf` formats, then they are automatically pushed back to github.

Requires the presence of the `unoconv` program - that perfoms the actual format conversion.
