<p>Dear Mr. Sutton, 
</p>
<p>Recently Booking.com has caught my eye as a great place to work,
with a great team and an interesting work proposition. I believe my
skills as a Systems and Applications Engineer and my experience with
Process Automation would be valuable assets Booking.com could use to
improve it's systems scalability and reliability.</p>
<p>I was around 10 years old when a Apple II clone made its debut at
home. I started programming by then and along the years fiddled with
a quite large number of programming languages. Around 1994 I started
using Linux. A couple of years later I accepted my first job as a
System Administrator. Back then, I was still convinced I would become
a professional software developer. Particularly, until the end of the
1990's I worked as Perl developer, making small web sites. By that
time I got involved with the Java community, and I started working in
that scene for a while. Eventually I became involved with the Perl
community again later on, becoming leader of the SÃ£o Paulo Perl
Mongers for a short period. Then, about 10 years ago, I decided to
embrace administration/support as my professional choice and I spent
the next 5 years building, deploying, and supporting java-based web
applications. This provided for an interesting balance between System
Administration and Software Development.</p>
<p>Since 2012 I have been supporting, monitoring, and troubleshooting
issues ranging from small glitches to major catastrophic incidents in
a high-volume, mission-critical environment for Movile, Brazil.
During this time I was responsible for dealing with gigantic
databases and complex software, with a large number of interfaces to
many other integrated systems, both within the company and with
external business partners.</p>
<p>Please consider my application for the role of Site Reliability
Engineer. For this purpose, please find attached a Curriculum Vitae.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.</p>
<p>I am looking forward for your reply.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
