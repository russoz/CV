<p>Dear Mr. Sutton, 
</p>
<p>I write this cover letter to express my interest in working at
Booking.com. I believe my skills in systems &amp; applications
administration and processes automation are a great asset in
achieving the improvements in scalability and reliability described
in this job offer.</p>
<p>I was around 10 years old when a Apple II clone made its debut at
home. I started programming by then and along the years messed with a
quite number of programming languages. I started using Linux in '94,
and became sysadmin at the office a couple of years later, but I was
still  convinced I was going to be a professional programmer. By the
end of the 90's I got deeply involved with the Java community, and I
did work in that scene for a good while. Then, about 10 years ago, I
decided to embrace administration/support as my professional choice
and I spent the next 5 years in support for java-based web
applications: building, deploying, configuring, troubleshooting, etc,
which was an interesting balance between administering and
programming, at the time.</p>
<p>For the past 4 years I have been working with high-volume,
mission-critical environment: monitoring, supporting and
troubleshooting problems ranging from small glitches to big
catastrophic events, dealing with gigantic databases and complex
software, integrated with many and varied other systems, both within
the company or with external partners. 
</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I am looking forward to
hearing from you.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
